(Built-in Datasets: Sunspots Time Series & Wine Classification)

Developed predictive models using statistical (ARIMA) and machine learning techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost), achieving 85%+ accuracy in classification tasks.

Conducted time series analysis (ADF tests, seasonal decomposition) on 300+ years of solar data, reducing forecast error (RMSE: 15.2) with ARIMA modeling.

Built classification models for wine quality prediction, implementing hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV to optimize performance metrics (precision, recall).

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib/Seaborn, including correlation heatmaps, feature importance visualization, and trend decomposition.

Automated data preprocessing pipelines (feature scaling, train-test splits) and serialized models using Pickle for deployment readiness.

Designed a Flask API prototype for model deployment, demonstrating end-to-end ML workflow from EDA to production.

Skills Demonstrated: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, XGBoost, Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA), Classification Models, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation (RMSE, Accuracy), Data Visualization, Flask.
